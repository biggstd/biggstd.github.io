# Tyler Biggs' Website

Welcome, my name is Tyler. I began programming during my doctoral research in synthetic organic chemistry,
and have now transitioned into chem/bioinformatics.

This site is a small collection of 'data science' projects that I found interesting, and I hope you do as well.

[***Learning Programming with Conway's Game of Life***](./docs/raytrace_gol)

I began but never completed a short course or module designed to introduce programming for data science to 
graduate students. Preparing material for students with such a wide range of potential experiences is challenging,
and I never was able to polish the course to any degree. That said, the capstone project for the students produces
some lovely ray-traced images, and the method we use to permute each step of the game using a convolution is a good
step from a programming point of view to a mathematical and scientific one.
